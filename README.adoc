A Kramdown converter for converting Markdown content to {uri-asciidoc}[AsciiDoc].

== Installation

Currently, {project-name} is only available in source form.
You'll need to retrieve the source and run the application out the source directory.

=== Retrieve the source code

Simply copy the {uri-repo}[GitHub repository URL] and pass it to the `git clone` command:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ git clone {uri-repo}

Next, switch to the project directory:

[subs=attributes+]
 $ cd {project-handle}

=== Prepare RVM (optional)

We recommend using {uri-rvm}[RVM] when developing applications with Ruby.
We like RVM because it keeps the dependencies required by the project isolated from the rest of your system.
Follow the {uri-install-rvm}[installation instructions] on the RVM site to setup RVM and install Ruby.

Once you have RVM setup, switch to the RVM-managed version of Ruby recommended by the project using this command:

 $ rvm use

The recommended version of Ruby is defined in the [.path]_.ruby-version_ file at the root of the project.

=== Install the dependencies

The dependencies needed to use {project-name} are defined in the [.path]_Gemfile_ at the root of the project.
You'll use Bundler to install these dependencies.

To check if you have Bundler available, use the `bundle` command to query the version installed:

 $ bundle --version

If it's not installed, use the `gem` command to install it.

 $ gem install bundler

Then, use the `bundle` command to install the project dependencies under the project directory:

 $ bundle --path=.bundle/gems

NOTE: You must invoke `bundle` from the project's root directory so it can locate the [.path]_Gemfile_.

== Usage

Convert a Markdown file to AsciiDoc:

 $ bundle exec kramdown-asciidoc sample.md

The script will automatically create the output file [.path]_sample.adoc_, replacing the Markdown file extension, `.md` with the AsciiDoc file extension, `.adoc`.

At the moment, the script assumes the input uses the GitHub-flavor Markdown (GFM) syntax.
